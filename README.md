# Traffic Simulation Program

This is a C++ program for simulating traffic at an intersection. It generates cars and simulates traffic lights based on different strategies chosen by the user.

## Features

- **Car Generation**: Cars are generated at the intersection based on the selected strategy.
- **Traffic Light Simulation**: Traffic lights change according to the selected strategy, controlling the flow of traffic at the intersection.
- **Two Strategies**: Two different strategies are available for simulating traffic flow.

## Usage

1. **Compile**: Compile the program using a C++ compiler.

2. **Run**: Execute the compiled program.


3. **Input Strategy**: Enter the desired strategy number (1 or 2) when prompted.

4. **Simulation**: The program will continuously simulate traffic based on the chosen strategy.

5. **Exit**: Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the simulation.

## File Structure

- `traffic_simulation.cpp`: Main C++ source code file containing the program logic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the program and its usage.
